  Connor Jaksik's Personal Portfolio
</h1>

Hello World. My name is Connor Jaksik. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Boulder, Colorado. This is the source code for my personal portfolio. Initially this project was created to showcase my web development skills, however the long-term goal is to showcase my other passions and achievements as well. This will also serve as a platform to make my career and life goals public to the world as a form of self-accountability.
